# OneTwoSlider
OneTwoSlider is an Android library for adding a customizable slider with either one or two handles to your application. The library works with Android since SDK 23.

## Features
While there exist several slider libs for Android which allow you to select values on a scale between a min and a max value they were hard to cusomize for my application and didn't support setting a second value. 

OneTwoSlider allows you to easily customize the slider to meet your design requirements and also supports a second handle for selecting two values, e.g. for selecting a filter range.

Additionally OneTwoSlider allows you to add conversion factors, which can be used to use an internal value range for your data structure but another value range for display - e.g. for kilometers to mile conversion.

If it comes to labelling, OneTwoSlider supports floating values, which shows the selected value directly above the selection handle. The floating value can be customized in color, textsize and fontfamily.

Reading out values is done by attaching a listener to the slider which is called every time when a selection value changes.
